Survival: Survival is one of the fundamental basic needs we all have according to William Glasser's theory. It encompasses our physiological requirements for food, water, shelter, and safety. When your need for survival is high, it means that these basic necessities become your top priority. Your focus shifts towards ensuring your physical well-being and securing your immediate environment. You may find yourself more cautious and alert, taking proactive steps to guarantee your safety and sustenance. This heightened need for survival may lead you to prioritize finding a stable job, securing a reliable source of income, and maintaining a secure living situation.

Love and Belonging: Belonging is an essential basic need that influences our overall well-being. It encompasses our desire for love, social connections, friendships, and a sense of community. When your need for love is higher compared to other needs, it means that developing and nurturing relationships becomes a central focus in your life. You may seek out opportunities to connect with others, whether it's through joining clubs, participating in social events, or engaging in meaningful conversations. Building strong and supportive relationships helps you feel connected and accepted, providing a sense of belonging and fulfillment.

Power: The need for power refers to our desire for autonomy, influence, and control over our lives. When your need for power is higher compared to other needs, it means that you have a strong drive to shape your own destiny and make decisions that align with your values. You strive for independence and assertiveness, aiming to take charge of your circumstances. Having a higher need for power means that you value personal autonomy and may gravitate towards leadership roles or situations where you can have a significant impact and influence others.

Freedom: Freedom is a crucial basic need that reflects our yearning for personal autonomy, self-expression, and the ability to make choices freely. When your need for freedom is higher compared to other needs, it means that you highly value your independence and resist constraints or limitations imposed by others. You prioritize opportunities that allow you to exercise your individuality, creativity, and self-determination. Having a higher need for freedom drives you to seek environments that support personal growth, encourage exploration, and offer flexibility in decision-making.

Fun: Fun, as a basic need, represents our desire for enjoyment, pleasure, learning and intellectual stimulation and a sense of playfulness in life. When your need for fun is higher compared to other needs, it means that you prioritize activities and experiences that bring you joy and entertainment. You seek out opportunities for relaxation, leisure, and laughter. Having a higher need for fun may lead you to explore hobbies, engage in recreational activities, enjoy learning new things, and spend time with friends or loved ones in pursuit of shared experiences that bring happiness and light-heartedness to your life.
